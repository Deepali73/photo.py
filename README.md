# 🖼️ Create Images from Scratch using Python (OpenCV + NumPy)

This project demonstrates how to **generate digital images from scratch** using only Python libraries like **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and optionally **Matplotlib**. It showcases the power of programmatic image creation — from pixel-level drawing to complex shapes and text overlays.

## 📌 Features

- ✨ Create a blank canvas with custom size and color
- 🎨 Draw basic shapes (lines, circles, rectangles, ellipses)
- 🧠 Add text with different fonts and sizes
- 🌀 Generate patterns and gradients using NumPy
- 💡 Save the image to disk in `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.bmp` format
